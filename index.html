            <h1>Phase 1: User research</h1>
            <img src="IMAGES/Phase 1 image.png">
            <p>During our research, we thoroughly analysed the heuristics of five competitors, paying close attention to key features that impact user experience. This involved evaluating elements such as the visibility and engagement of the donate button, user-friendly processes, the use of carousel images to captivate users, clickable links in the footer, and an intuitive drop-down menu for streamlined navigation. We also conducted focus group testing and surveys. Our main objective was to assess the website's aesthetics and usability. Although users didn't encounter significant issues during navigation, they expressed a strong desire for enhanced transparency regarding how their donations would be utilized and the resulting impact. It's worth noting that some users raised concerns about trustworthiness, which had a direct influence on their motivation to make donations.</p>

            <img src="IMAGES/Phase 4 lo fi prototype.png">
            <p>A few comments we took in for changes were text size and donation design being too playful on our Low to Mid-fi prototypes. After a group discussion we decides to update the typeface in our navigation bar to enhance readability and create contrast to the rest of the page. And we also made adjustments by changing the body text for a friendlier yet more serious tone and made simple changes to the box.

            <p>We started with a usability test plan, our primary objective is to assess the aesthetic usability of the website and the secondary objective is to learn about user browsing behaviour. Our target users are individuals in their mid 20s to early 30s who have experience with technology. We used Maze to do the usability testing and generated the results.</p>

            <p>WGiven more time we would have also liked to redesign other pages on the website, and explore our other ideas we had, such as: 1. More animated designs - To improve website interaction and user experience. 2. Virtual dog assistant -Guides you from page to page, and answer any FAQ or support in general. 3. Create your own dog - Adoption process that matches the user with what they are looking for and suitable for them.
